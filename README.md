# generator-patternslib

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for creating a [Patternslib](http://patternslib.com) pattern.

Patternslib is a toolkit for making interaction patterns which designers can
use to create rich, functional prototypes without having to know or use any
Javascript.

## Creating a new pattern:

Run the following:

```
    mkdir pat-example && cd pat-example
    yo patternslib pat-example 
```

where ``pat-example`` is the name of the pattern you'd like to create.
